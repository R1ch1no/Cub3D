# Cub3D

Done in collaboration with https://github.com/Nikola-Prljic

Cub3D is 42 project, written in C, that is supposed to replicate pseudo 3D enviroment similiar to Wofelstein 3D. 
Goal of the project is to learn raycasting and how to use it in order to render a maze.
The player can move the camera point with WASD keys and change the camera angle with <- and -> keys.
Game can be closed with either ESC key or X button on the window itself.
Project uses Mlx library.
You most probably will need to download MLX library and configure Makefile and headerfile based on mlx usage (whether the user installs it on the device or wants to use archive file only).
